The one thing that bugs me about Spotify is you only get 15 hours to listen to audiobooks for only a month. I finished that in a day and a half and now I have to wait to listen to the rest of my book. It's extremely annoying and I just want to listen to my audiobooks non stop like the songs.,3

8d73c5da-4c27-41d1-9ab2-df2ec1f28877,This was the best app but now it's become the worst. I don't know why spotify is begging to take premium. We rewind or choose any part of the song to play. Moreover now we can play our playlist peacefully because of smart shuffle. Also we can't skip songs if we skip more than 6 songs. We can play a song once per day. Means if you play a song and then you want to play it again you can't. It says that you have to play it the next day.,1

Worst app ever designed for music that controls your music and doesn't even let you skip the song, restart the song, shuffle as you like. Even Instagram has better audio quality than this app. And now it also have login issues. It won't let me reset my password nor let me login with Google account. Pls guys, you should shut this business, if this quality is to be continued",1

c66fb5a6-7730-41b4-a662-ad39d7e5cd75,This is the worst update ever. You have to pay to skip the song or repeat it. We need to pay to play the songs in order. This is my favorite music app and I am using it for almost 2 and a half years. This account is used on various devices. Why are you making us to pay for the essential or the main features for the comfort of the customer. You're getting worse . The app's playing random songs which we don't want to hear at that moment. Pls make it more usable and normal like the previous update.,1

Every time I open the app it starts playing a random track from a random artist that, often, I've never heard of. No setting to disable that. Also, ""smart shuffle"" is a really dumb idea and despite an overwhelmingly negative reception of this feature, there is no setting to permanently disable. The app is also just seeming very bugged and glitchy lately.",1
